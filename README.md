# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
## *Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends*
---
* Based on our visualization from the 'Parent Category Outcomes', we can see that theater Kickstarters were the most successful crowdfunding projects overall.

* As chart, 'Outcomes Based on Launch Date' shows, theater plays that start earlier in the year (around May or June) are more likely to be successful than those that start later on in the year.

* Under the 'Descriptive Statistics' tab, we can see that theater plays that failed in the U.S. had a higher average goal amount than the successful campaigns. These statistics also show that some of the failed Kickstarters had extremely high goals.
---
* Included in the analysis is research into the Edinburgh plays and gives more insight into the details of their successful play campaigns. You can see which had more contributors and what the average monetary contributions were.
---
* My final analysis notes:
1. For a successful theater play campaign in the U.S., begin the Kickstarter campaign earlier in the year because after June the success rate declines the rest of the year.
2. Having a higher than average goal amount for a fundraiser will greatly decrease the chance of it succeeding.
