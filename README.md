# **Kickstarting with Excel**
## **Overview of Project**
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
---
### **Background of Project**
---
The purpose of this project was to assist Louise in analysing Kickstarter data to look for trends that would help her with her own Kickstarter campaign. She had a goal of $12,000 to raise and getting to look through historical data outcomes from other similar projects helped in making crucial decisions for her theater play's success.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
---
The initial dataset contained over 4,000 rows of Kickstarter data, so the first course of action was to look at what kind of data there was and decide the best conversion of it so Louise could view it more easily. Some of the columns had to be re-formatted into the correct structure before any analyses could be pulled from them.
